## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML deployed source code. In the table below, the results are labeled by template file that would render the respective page. The results are validated using the live deployed version of the project.

| Directory | File | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| booking | cancel_session.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-cancel-session.png) |
| booking | payment.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-payment.png) |

| templates | usersession_list.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-usersession-list.png) |
| tutor_market | add-tutor.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-add-tutor.png) |
| tutor_market | calendly_information.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-calendly.png) |
| tutor_market | edit_tutor.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-edit-tutor.png) |
| tutor_market | student_dashboard.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-student-dashboard.png) |
| tutor_market | tutor_confirm-delete.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-tutor-confirm-delete.png) |
| tutor_market | tutor_dashboard.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-tutor-dashboard.png) |
| tutor_market | tutor_detail.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-tutor-detail.png) |
| tutor_market | tutor_list.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-html-tutor-list.png) |

**Note about Mailchimp form:** The mailchimp form contains inline styles that pass validation but usually aren't good practice. Moving the styles to the base.css file came with bugs becase of the mailchimp javascript and css files. The form is working as intended and the inline styles are kept for now. Compare issue [#126](https://github.com/benschaf/gipfel-tutor/issues/126).

No validation issues are present in the HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

![jigsaw badge](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue)

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | base.css | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-css-base-css.png) | All warnings are either about third party css or vendor prefixes. |
| static | custom_bootstrap.css | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-custom-bootstrap-css.png) | The only warning is about jigsaw not being able to validate css import statements using @ |

Most warnings are due to the vendor prefixes that are used in the CSS files. I added the prefixes using the [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io) tool. The prefixes are necessary for the CSS to work on all browsers.

There were no other issues with the CSS files.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) via its command-line interface to validate all of my JavaScript files. for this I installed the jshint package as a dev dependency using the command `npm install jshint --save-dev`. After this I created a `.jshintrc` file in the `root` directory of the project with the following content in order to enable ES6 syntax:

```json
{
    "esversion": 8
}
```

Note: I used the `esversion: 8` option to enable ES6 syntax and asynchonous functions, as async functions would throw a warning when using the ES6 syntax.

I then ran the following command to validate all of my JavaScript files: `npx jshint <directory>/<filename.js>`:

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| booking | [payment.js](booking/static/booking/js/payment.js) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-js-payment-js.png) |

| static | [base.js](static/js/base.js) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-js-base-js.png) |
| static | [base.test.js](static/js/tests/base.test.js) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-js-base-test-js.png) |
| tutor_market | [tutor_detail.js](tutor_market/static/tutor_market/js/tutor_detail.js) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-js-tutor-detail-js.png) |
| tutor_market | [tutor_list.js](tutor_market/static/tutor_market/js/tutor_list.js) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation-js-tutor-list-js.png) |

There were no errors or warnings with the JavaScript files.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

Files that are unchanged from the Django template have been excluded from the validation as they are known to be valid.

Additionaly to the final testing, pycodestyle was used frequently to test python files locally.

To install pycodestyle, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pycodestyle
```

By running the command `pycodestyle --exclude=.vscode/*,*/migrations/* .` in the terminal, I was able to check for any PEP8 violations in all of my Python files. The `--exclude` flag was used to exclude the `.vscode` and `migrations` directories from the test as they are not written by me or automatically generated by Django.

There were no issues with the Python files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project manually on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. I've tested the project on the latest versions of the following browsers:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)

See the table below for the compatibility results (click on an image to enlarge it):

There were no compatibility issues on any of the browsers tested.

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues. I've used the Chrome Developer Tools to simulate the devices. I have also tested the project on a physical Google Pixel 6 device.

There were no additional responsiveness issues on any of the devices tested.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool in the Chrome Developer Tools to mainly check for accessibility and best practices but also to check for performance and SEO.

Best Practices is only about 78% on all sites because of the 3rd party cookies by Calendly. This is a known issue and can be ignored.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Without the following, Jest won't properly run the tests:

- `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom`

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

For this project I only ran one test and one test suite, as an example. The test suite was for the `base.html` and `base.js` files. The test was for the `updateCopyrightNotice`function.

Below are the results from the Jest tests:

| File | Function | Test | Result | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| base.js | updateCopyrightNotice | Checks if the year is updated to the current year | The year is updated to the current year | ![screenshot](documentation/tests-js-test-base.png) |

No more jest testing was conducted due to all of the JavaScript functions relying on either the Stripe or the Calendly services. Testing these functions would require mocking the services, which is beyond the scope of this project.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`pip3 install coverage`

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

`coverage run --omit=/site-packages/,/migrations/,env.py,*/init.py,*/manage.py manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

#### Test Results

I have conducted a total of 79 tests across all of my apps in the project, all of which are passing.

![screenshot](documentation/test-py-all.png)

⤴️ This is a screenshot of the test results in the console.

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested (covered files are skipped to keep the screenshot reasonably sized):

![screenshot](documentation/test-py-coverage.png)

⤴️ This is a screenshot of the coverage report in the console.

The current tests reach a coverage of 86% across all apps.

Below are screenshots of the files' reports that didn't reach 100% coverage:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| booking | views.py | 47% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-booking-views.png) | Testsing for statements that rely on Stripe or Calendly services was not done as it is out of scope of this project. |
| booking | webhook_handler.py | 24% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-booking-webhook-handler.png) | same comment as above |
| booking | webhooks.py | 37% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-booking-webhooks.png) | same comment as above |
| calendly | views.py | 73% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-calendly-views.png) | same comment as above |
| core | models.py | 88% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-core-models.png) | \__str__ methods are not tested |
| tutor_market | models.py | 96% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-tutor-market-models.png) | \__str__ methods are not tested |
| tutor_market | views.py | 90% | ![screenshot](documentation/test-tutor-market-views.png) | most statements could be tested |
| gipfel_tutor | settings.py | 68% | no screenshot | settings.py is not tested |

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests and a higher coverage would be more comprehensive.

## Bugs

⤴️ This is a screenshot of the bugs that were fixed.

Note: Many of the bugs were only tracked in github issues retroactively. For these bugs, the commit that fixed the bug is linked in a comment of the issue. That way, all of the bugs, fixes and the process of fixing them can be tracked from within Github issues.

### Unfixed Bugs

At the moment of submission, there are no known bugs that are still open.

### Open issues

At this time, any issues that are still open are User stories that have been labeled as either should have, could have or won't have. These issues are deliberately left open. As mentioned in the README.md, these issues are deliberately left with their could have or should have labels as they are frozen at the end of the last iteration (Compare [README.md](README.md#github-projects)).
