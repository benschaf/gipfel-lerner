Welcome to Gipfel Tutor, the pinnacle of personalized tutoring for Swiss students! Our Django-powered marketplace pairs you with the perfect tutor to conquer your academic peaks. Quick, simple, and effective â€” scale new heights in learning with us!

> **Our Mission**:
>
> "Connect learners with a highly suitable tutor for their specific **needs** and **preferences**, within **48 hours*."

**Better Matching system**:
    The platform offers a sophisticated matching system that leverages detailed tutor profiles. Tutors are required to provide a comprehensive description of their experience, qualifications, and teaching valuess (via tags they can select). Additionally, students can filter their search using relevant tags associated with the tutor's expertise . A star rating system and experience metrics (number of lessons taught, years of experience) further help students find a tutor that closely aligns with their needs.

## UI/UX Design

## Database Design

## Tools and Technologies
- ![calendly_api](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Calendly%20API-1A1A1A?style=flat&logo=calendly)
> [!Note]
> I mainly want to use the simpler embed feature of Calendly. It would be really cool though to use the api v2 they provide mainly to enable searching tutors based on their avaliability. Also without using the api webhooks, smooth cancellations are basically impossible. (seems like future feature stuff)

## Marketing

## Design Thinking Process

### Empathize

For this stage, I created 4 user personas to represent the different types of users that would interact with the app.

For each persona, I considered their "5 Cs" (circumstances, constraints, context, criteria, and compensating behaviors) related to online tutoring. This helped me understand the needs and motivations of the users.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the app is primary and secondary school and gymnasium students in Switzerland (or their parents, especially in the case of primary students). The app is also aimed at university students who are looking to become tutors and earn extra income.

The user personas are:

1. **Lara** - A 14 year old student who is struggling with math and needs a tutor to help her understand the concepts better.

2. **Jonas** - A 17 year old student who is preparing for his final exams and needs a tutor to help him with exam preparation.

3. **Sophie** - The Mother of a 9 year old student who is looking for a tutor to help her child with homework and assignments.

4. **David** - A 20 year old university student who is looking to make some extra money by tutoring students in his area of expertise.

5 C's for each persona:

1. **Lara**
- **Circumstances** - Lara is a secondary school student who is struggling with math. She needs a tutor to help her overcome her fear of math and build confidence in her abilities.
- **Challenges** - Lara finds it difficult to grasp complex mathematical concepts and struggles with problem-solving techniques.
- **Context** - Lara is looking for a tutor who can provide personalized guidance and support to help her improve her math skills.
- **Criteria** - Lara is seeking a tutor who is patient, understanding, and skilled at breaking down complex concepts into simpler terms.
- **Compensating Behaviors** - Lara has been relying on online tutorials and videos, but she believes that a dedicated tutor can provide the individual attention she needs to excel in math.

2. **Jonas**
- **Circumstances** - Jonas is a high school student who is preparing for his final exams. He needs a tutor to help him develop effective study strategies and improve his exam performance.
- **Challenges** - Jonas struggles with time management and organizing study materials effectively for his exams.
- **Context** - Jonas is looking for a tutor who can provide structured study plans, practice exams, and effective revision techniques. He is also in a hurry to find a tutor as his exams are approaching.
- **Criteria** - Jonas is seeking a tutor who is experienced, knowledgeable, and can help him develop effective study habits and exam-taking strategies.
- **Compensating Behaviors** - Jonas has been using online study resources, but he believes that a tutor can provide personalized guidance and feedback to help him achieve better results in his exams.

3. **Sophie**
- **Circumstances** - Sophie is the mother of a 9-year-old student who is struggling with homework and assignments. She needs a tutor to provide additional support and guidance to her child.
- **Challenges** - Sophie's child finds it challenging to focus on homework and often gets overwhelmed with complex assignments.
- **Context** - Sophie is looking for a tutor who can create a structured learning environment, provide engaging activities, and offer personalized attention to her child's learning needs.
- **Criteria** - Sophie is seeking a tutor who is patient, creative, and experienced in teaching young children.
- **Compensating Behaviors** - Sophie has been trying to help her child with online resources, but she believes that a tutor can provide the necessary guidance and support to improve her child's academic performance.

4. **David**
- **Circumstances** - David is a 20-year-old university student who wants to become a tutor to share his expertise and earn extra income.
- **Challenges** - David faces difficulties in finding students who are interested in his area of expertise and matching his availability with their schedules.
- **Context** - David is looking for a platform that can connect him with students who need help in his specific field of expertise.
- **Criteria** - David is seeking a platform that provides a wide reach, efficient scheduling, and a secure payment system for his tutoring services.
- **Compensating Behaviors** - David has been exploring online tutoring platforms, but he believes that a dedicated platform can help him find more students and streamline the tutoring process.

### Define

Considering all the user Personas, I created a problem statement that would guide the design of the app.

The problem statement is:

"How might we create a platform that connects students with a highly suitable tutor for their specific needs and preferences, within 48 hours."

### Ideate

Considering the problem statement and the user personas, I brainstormed ideas for the app. I considered the features that would be most important to the users.

The Features are already sorted by priority although these priorities are subject to change, especially once the user stories are created.

1. **Lara**:
    - **p1** - Search for tutors based on subject and teaching values.
    - **p1** - View detailed tutor profiles with ratings and reviews.
    - **p2** - Book a trial lesson with a tutor - so she can see if the tutor is a good fit.

2. **Jonas**:
    - **p3** - Search for tutors based on subject and experiecne with a specific exam.
    - **p2** - Get in contact with a tutor to discuss study plans and exam strategies.
    - **p1** - Schedule regular lessons with a tutor to prepare for exams.

3. **Sophie**:
    - **p1** - Search for tutors based on subject and experience with young children.
    - **p1** - View tutor profiles with information on teaching values and activities.
    - **p1** - Schedule lessons with a tutor to help her child with homework and assignments.

4. **David**:
    - **p1** - Create a tutor profile with information on expertise and teaching values.
    - **p1** - Set availability and hourly rates for tutoring services.
    - **p1** - Receive booking requests from students and confirm lessons.

### Prototype

After ideating I created wireframes and content for the prototype of the site which is of course this repository.

Check out the full prototype including wireframes, user stories, and the working site by browsing around the readme and the repository. Also check out [the website](#) itself.

### Test

The prototype of the site was tested manually and progamatically to ensure that it is working as intended. Testing in the sense of design thinking has not been very extensive yet. This will be done in the future.

## Business and Costumer Goals

The business goals of the app are to provide a platform where students can find tutors for their specific needs and preferences. The app aims to set itself apart from other tutoring platforms by providing a better matching system that leverages detailed tutor profiles, ratings, and reviews. The app also aims to provide a seamless user experience for both students and tutors, with features such as detailed tutor profiles, booking requests, and online payments.

Maybe formulate project goals and map them to user stories - but this seems unnecessary at the moment.
